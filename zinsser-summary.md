# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Bradley Cruce 

Clear writing is hard work. Zinsser explains that clutter makes writing unclear. If a reader cannot understand, it is likely the writers fault. Every word in a sentence should serve a purpose and writing is more clear with fewer words. It forces the writer to simplify. Since readers have 30 second attention spans, it is necessary to simplify each sentence as much as possible. A writer should always ask themselves what they are trying to say and if theyâ€™ve said it. This is hard work but it makes the writing interesting and clear.
